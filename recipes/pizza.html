    <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <li>Optional seasonings: dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating to ensure it gets hot.</li>
    <li>Prepare the pizza dough: If using store-bought dough, follow package instructions for preparation. If using homemade dough, roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Assemble the pizza: Place the rolled-out dough on a lightly greased pizza pan or parchment paper. Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Spread pizza sauce: Spoon the pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it evenly, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
    <li>Add cheese: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Optionally, add grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>Add toppings (optional): Customize your pizza with any desired toppings, such as sliced tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, or olives.</li>
    <li>Season (optional): Sprinkle dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes over the pizza for additional flavor.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the assembled pizza to the preheated oven. If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Slice into wedges and serve hot.</li>
