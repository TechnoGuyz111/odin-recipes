        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat your oven: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating to ensure it gets hot.</li></p>
            <p><li>Prepare the pizza dough: If using store-bought dough, follow package instructions for preparation. If using homemade dough, roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li></p>
            <p><li>Assemble the pizza: Place the rolled-out dough on a lightly greased pizza pan or parchment paper. Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil.</li></p>
            <p><li>Spread pizza sauce: Spoon the pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it evenly, leaving a small border around the edges.</li></p>
            <p><li>Add cheese: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Optionally, add grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</li></p>
            <p><li>Add toppings (optional): Customize your pizza with any desired toppings, such as sliced tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, or olives.</li></p>
            <p><li>Season (optional): Sprinkle dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes over the pizza for additional flavor.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the assembled pizza to the preheated oven. If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li></p>
            <p><li>Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Slice into wedges and serve hot.</li></p>
