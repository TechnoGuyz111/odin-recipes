Practise basic HTML by making a simple recipe webpage.
Practise use of common features of a simple HTML webpage, such as boilerplates, and learn use cases for text, links and images in a HTML webpage.

After completing this project I have learnt how to incorporate links and images into webpages, as well as use cases for basic elements such as headings and lists.
